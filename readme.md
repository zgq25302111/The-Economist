**我是谁？**

常泡山楂水喝，所以公众号取名为「一杯山楂水」。86年生，内蒙古人，专业是计算机，在北京从事IT工作多年，热爱Coding和英语，长跑爱好者，从未怀疑科技在我这里的力量。每日阅读《经济学人》等英语杂志，用英语获取新知，与世界持续连线。希望我们一起通过用英语这件小事，做有趣的事认识有意思的人，成为更自律、自信的自己。

Born and bred in a north town in Inner Mongolia, Guoqiang,Zhang, a.k.a(also known as) HappyJack, is an unyieldingly lifelong learner specializing in computer and English. 

HappyJack learns to write and writes to learn. He practices what he preaches. He reads The Economist daily, and read notes can be found on his WeChat account english_maybush.

He spends more time thinking and learning than sleeping. He produces tons of ideas, captures some, and metamorphoses some of them into writings, many of which also appear on the WeChat account. 

He thanks his first English teacher Mr.Tian in junior high school for rapidly turning his initial and short-lived aversion to English into deep and never-ending affection. His mentor and life coach Lianyue deserves no less credit as he kindled his zeal for fearlessly and skillfully acquiring progress. Words tried but failed to express his gratitude. 

Boy as bright as he is, finds the difficult material to be a challenge. He finds it energizing. He is more likely to redouble his efforts. What's going on? It's not a question of ability. The question is how people approach a challenge. So do things challenge you.

Give an example.Coding, it's an endless process of trial and error, of trying to get the right command in the right place, with sometimes just a semicolon making the difference between success and failure. Code breaks and then it falls apart, and it often takes many, many tries until that magical moment when what you're trying to build comes to life. It requires perseverance.
