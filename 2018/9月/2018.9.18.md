##Tech firms disrupt the property market
Enter “instant buyers” such as Opendoor. *[1]These companies, known by the abbreviation “i-buyers”, try to do to property sales what Billy Beane did to baseball. Just as the manager of the Oakland A’s substituted software for conventional talent scouts, i-buyers replace estate agents with algorithms that crunch data on everything from the number of bedrooms to local crime rates, to estimate what a property should sell for. They then buy it at a discount to the computed price (as Mr Beane did with players), spruce it up and offload it.* Opendoor says its average fee is 6-6.5%, about the same cut as conventional estate agents take on a sale.
1. [1]名称缩写为“i-buyers”的公司试图像[2]Billy Beane对棒球所做的那样运营房地产销售业务。就像Oakland A的经理(Billy Beane)用软件取代传统星探那样，i-buyers用算法取代房地产中介，这类算法通过分析包括从卧室数量到当地犯罪率等等数据对房产作出估价。在估价基础上以一定折扣买下房产（像Billy Beane对棒球球员做的那样），重新修整后脱手。
2. In his front-office career, Billy Beane has applied statistical analysis (known as sabermetrics) to baseball, which has led teams to reconsider how they evaluate players. He is the subject of Michael Lewis's 2003 book on baseball economics, Moneyball, which was made into a 2011 film starring Brad Pitt as Beane.

That share will need to rise a lot before i-buyers make real money. In Phoenix Opendoor earned 6% on average per home, before repair costs and fees to buyers’ agents (who are paid by the seller in America and whom i-buyers have not displaced). Zillow has told investors to expect a profit of only 1.4% per home. Because around 85% of i-buyers’ purchases are financed with borrowed money, rising interest rates may squeeze margins further.*[3] Falling prices represent another risk. The potential market is massive, however. Spencer Rascoff, Zillow’s boss, estimates it at 2.75m homes in the biggest 200 cities in America (about half of the country’s 5.5m annual home sales). America has endless suburbs lined with millions of homes, and armies of estate agents who are often regarded with suspicion by buyers and sellers alike. If i-buyers can dispense with at least some of them, and speed up home sales in the process, few would grumble.*
1. 价格下跌意味着另一种风险。然而，潜在市场是巨大的。Zillow的老板估计，潜在市场是美国最大的200个城市中的每年275万套住房销量（占全美年550万套住房销量的一半）。美国有无数的郊区，拥有数以百万计的房屋，还有大批的房地产经纪人，他们经常被买家和卖家所怀疑。如果 i-buyers免去至少其中一些不信任，并加快房屋销售，就很少有人抱怨了。
