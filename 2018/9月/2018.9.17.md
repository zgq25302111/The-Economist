##America’s highest court needs term limits
*[1]THE judiciary, wrote Alexander Hamilton in Federalist Paper 78, “may truly be said to have neither FORCE nor WILL, but merely judgment...[It] is beyond comparison the weakest of the three departments of power.” *For much of American history, politicians saw the Supreme Court as a backwater. John Rutledge, one of the first justices appointed by George Washington, resigned to become chief justice of South Carolina. Not until 1935 did the court have a building of its own. Today it occupies a central and increasingly untenable position in American life (see Briefing).
1. [1]亚历山大·汉密尔顿在联邦党人文集78中写道，大法官“可能真的被认为既没有力量也没有意志，而仅仅是判断……”他是三个权力部门中最弱的一个。”
三权分立：立法（国会）、司法（大法官）、行政（总统）

The centrality stems largely from gridlock. *[2]As Congress has grown incapable of passing laws involving even straightforward political trade-offs, power has flowed to the executive and judicial branches.* *[3]Political questions best settled by the ballot box—about abortion, for instance, or gay marriage—have become legal ones settled by nine unelected judges.*
1. [2]由于国会已经无法通过法律，甚至连简单的政治权衡都无法通过，权力已经流向了行政和司法部门。
2. [3]政治问题过去是由投票箱解决——比如堕胎，或者同性婚姻——现在成为由9名未经选举产生的法官解决的法律问题。
