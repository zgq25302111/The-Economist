##Emerging economies are rapidly adding to the global pile of garbage
*[1]THE OFFICES OF Miniwiz in central Taipei display all the trappings of a vibrant startup.* The large open space on the 14th floor of an office block overlooking Taiwan’s capital is full of hip youngsters huddled around computer screens. A common area downstairs includes a video-game console, a table-tennis table and a basketball hoop. *[2]But a hint that this is not just another e-commerce venture comes from neatly sorted sacks packed with old plastic bottles, CDs and cigarette butts.*
1. [1]位于台北市中心的Miniwiz的办公室具有一家充满活力的创业公司的所有特征。
2. trappings:things such as money, influence, possessions etc that are related to a particular type of person, job, or way of life
the trappings of power 权力的标志
3. [2]但有迹象表明这不是另一家电子商务企业，它里面整齐地堆放着装满旧塑料瓶、CD和烟头的袋子。

Rather than peddle brand-new virtual products, Miniwiz derives value from physically repurposing old rubbish. Chairs in the conference room began life as plastic bottles, food packaging, aluminium cans and shoe soles. The translucent walls separating it from executives’ dens owe their amber-like quality to recycled plastic mixed with discarded wheat husks. Coffee is served in glasses made of broken iPhone screens. *[3]Arthur Huang, the company’s 40-year-old founder and chief executive, who holds a masters degree in architecture from Harvard, first tried setting up shop in New York in the mid-2000s. That effort failed when he discovered that few Americans shared his obsession with limiting the world’s waste. By contrast, many of his fellow Taiwanese did.*
1. translucent:not trans-parent, but clear enough to allow light to pass through
2. den:休息室
3. owe:把...归功于，有...是由于
4. [3]Arthur Huang今年40岁，是Miniwiz的CEO和创始人，哈佛大学建筑硕士毕业，在2000年首先在纽约建立车间。当他发现很少有美国人分享他对限制世界垃圾的痴迷时，这种努力就失败了。相比之下，他的许多台湾同胞支持他。

They still do. *[4]The island is a poster child for recycling, recovering 52% of rubbish collected from households and commerce, as well as 77% of industrial waste, rivalling rates achieved by South Korea, Germany and other top recycling nations (America recycles 26% and 44% respectively).* Its recycling industry brings in annual revenues of more than $2bn. *[5]Lee Ying-yuan, the environment minister, boasts that 16 of the 32 teams competing at this year’s football World Cup in Russia sported shirts made in Taiwan from fibres derived from recycled plastic.*
1. [4]台湾岛是废物回收利用的典型代表，回收了家庭和商业活动产生的垃圾的52%和工业垃圾中的72%，可以和韩国、德国等其他高回收率国家媲美（美国分别回收了26%和44%）。
2. 据说今年俄罗斯世界杯32支参赛队中的16支的运动T恤就是用回收塑料的纤维做成的，还是台湾做的，没想到吧。
