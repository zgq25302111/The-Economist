1. The Libya model is what Mr Kim fears most. It is prime evidence for the theory that has underpinned his regime’s nuclear programme, to the North Korean people’s cost, for five decades: possession of nuclear weapons equals regime survival; disarmament equals regime endangerment. 

   underpin：巩固，加强...的基础

   

2. When Mike Pence parroted that threat, the North Koreans called the vice-president “ignorant and stupid” and threatened a nuclear war. 

   parrot：鹦鹉，学舌者；机械的模仿

   

3. Mr Bolton, who doubts it is worth negotiating with Mr Kim and has long advocated toppling his regime, may not be displeased with that outcome. 

   topple：推翻

   

4. In 2009 Kanye West went into a “self-imposed exile” after humiliating a young artist at an awards show. He returned triumphantly in 2010 with an acclaimed album. 

   humiliate：使蒙羞，羞辱

   triumphantly :成功地，耀武扬威地

   

5. Then President Donald Trump changed his mind, as is his wont, and vowed to proceed with tariffs on $50bn of Chinese imports.

   wont：习惯，惯常活动
