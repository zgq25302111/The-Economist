##Arabic, a great language, has a low profile
Among their many reverberations, the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 had a linguistic side-effect. Between 2002 and 2009 the number of university students in America learning Arabic shot up by 231%, making it a more popular subject than Latin and Russian. This was a “Sputnik moment”: like the Soviet satellite, it shocked Americans into studying their adversaries.

*[1]But national attention soon wandered.* Arabic-learning declined by 10% between 2009 and 2016—years in which America continued to fight in Iraq and later against Islamic State. In both America and Britain, Arabic is just the eighth-most-studied language, behind less important but somehow sexier ones such as (in British a-level exams) Italian.
1. [1]但国民的注意力很快就走神了。

Arabic is the fifth-most-spoken language in the world, with more than 313m speakers. It is an official language in 25 countries—more than any other except English and French—and one of six official languages at the United Nations. As the vehicle of one of the great faiths, Islam, it is widely studied for religious reasons. *[2]So why does it seem to punch below its weight in the secular world?*
1. [2]那么，为什么它在世俗世界中似乎没有发挥出应有的影响力呢?

Part of the answer is that “Arabic”, today, is not really a single language at all. Scholars call it a “macrolanguage” instead. “Modern Standard Arabic” (msa) is the medium of serious writing and formal public speech across the Arab world. But Western students who sign up for a class in it soon discover that nobody speaks this “standard” as a native tongue; many Arabs hardly speak it at all. msa is based on the classical Arabic of the Koran—written in the 7th century—with additional vocabulary for modern life.

But oral languages do not sit still for 14 centuries, and spoken “Arabic” is really a group of dialects different enough to be considered separate languages. They are often put in five approximate categories: north African, Egyptian, Mesopotamian, Levantine and Peninsular Arabic. Speakers from distant regions can struggle to understand each other’s dialects.

*[3]The standard version relates to them roughly as Latin does to today’s Romance languages.* Consider Syrian Arabic. Some words are identical to their classical progenitors. But some sounds disappear, and others change wholesale: for example, the th sound becomes a d, s, t or z. Some dialectal words are borrowed from European languages, like talifoon (telephone), which is used alongside msa’s haatif. Others draw on local influences, such as Turkish. In many cases, words change meaning. Haka means to tell a story in msa, but it just means “to speak” in Syrian dialect. *[4]And the grammars are utterly different: the dialects are simpler than msa, but they must still be learned mostly anew.*
1. [3]标准版本阿拉伯语与现代阿拉伯语的关系大致类似于拉丁语与今天的罗曼语的关系。
2. [4]语法是完全不同的:方言的语法比标准阿拉伯语简单，但它们仍然需要重新学习。

The foreigner who wants to both read and speak Arabic, in other words, needs to acquire, if not quite two languages, one and a half. Worse, none of the dialects is big enough to play the role that Mandarin does in the Chinese family. Egyptian has generally been the best-known, thanks to the country’s heft in population and culture. But its native speakers are mostly limited to Egypt, with its stagnant economy and politics. No wonder attrition among learners is high; for every five who take up Arabic, roughly one makes it to advanced classes.

〔对敌人的〕消耗，消磨

2. 换句话说，想要既能读又能说阿拉伯语的外国人，即使不是掌握两种语言，也是掌握一种半阿拉伯语。更糟糕的是，没有一种方言的影响力足够大的像汉语中的普通话（汉语有很多种方言）。由于埃及在人口和文化上的重要性，阿拉伯语埃及语系通常是最知名的。但以阿拉伯语为母语的人大多局限于经济和政治停滞不前的埃及。难怪成材率很低：每五名学习阿拉伯语的学生中，大约有一名能达到高级别。

For Arabs, the dialects pose less of an everyday problem than all this might suggest. By improvising, Arabs from different regions do manage to talk to each other. They use features shared across the bigger dialects, as well as bits of msa, while avoiding the peculiarities of their own dialects as much as possible.

A bigger problem is the nature of msa. To read or write, Arabs essentially use a foreign language, one often taught with stultifying conservatism in schools. *[5]Some do so happily, proud of its long history, its complex and subtle grammar or its intimate links with Islam. But many ordinary people prefer reading or writing in languages such as French or English.* French, supposedly in decline, has a quarter as many native speakers, but quite a lot more clout. To give one approximate measure, there are three times as many articles in French on Wikipedia as in Arabic, with five times as many edits. The Arabic book market is about a quarter the size of Belgium’s.
1. [5]有些人则乐此不疲，为其悠久的历史、复杂微妙的语法或与伊斯兰教的密切联系而自豪。但许多普通人更喜欢用法语或英语等语言阅读或写作。

All this is a shame. Many Westerners might associate the language with today’s repressive Middle Eastern regimes, but there is far more to Arabic than that. It is the medium of Moses Maimonides’s medieval Jewish philosophy, the novels of Naguib Mahfouz and the songs of Feyrouz. No region, and no people or language, should ever be judged on its politics alone.
1. 多么遗憾啊。许多西方人可能会把阿拉伯语与当今专制的中东政权联系在一起，但阿拉伯语远不止这些。它是摩西·迈蒙尼德(Moses Maimonides)中世纪犹太哲学、纳吉布·马福兹(Naguib Mahfouz)的小说和费罗斯(Feyrouz)的歌曲的媒介。任何地区、任何民族或任何语言都不应仅凭其政治被评判。
