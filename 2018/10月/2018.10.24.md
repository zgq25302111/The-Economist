Curbing the power of big business is hard
约束财阀的力量是困难的

Cho imho is angry. Perched on an enormous black leather chair, the director of South Korea’s association of small businesses throws up his arms in despair as he discusses the government’s economic policy. Mr Cho reserves particular ire for the recent increase in the minimum wage to 7,530 won ($6.65) an hour, 16% more than it was a year ago. The leap is the centrepiece of the government’s plan to revive the economy by boosting the incomes of the poor; further hikes are planned. Mr Cho claims many of the firms he represents are considering shutting down. Others have shed staff. “It’s crazy, a disaster,” he says.
Cho imho生气了。韩国小企业联合会会长坐在一张巨大的黑色皮革座椅上，绝望地举起双臂，谈论着韩国政府的经济政策。Cho imho对最近将最低工资提高到7530韩元(合6.65美元)一小时的做法特别不满，比一年前高出16%。提高最低工资是政府通过提高穷人收入来振兴经济计划的核心内容；计划将进一步提高最低工资。Cho imho表示，他所代表的许多小企业正在考虑关闭，另一些公司则裁员。“这太疯狂了，简直是一场灾难，”他说。

Mr Cho is a proud right-winger from Daegu, a nest of South Korean conservatism. His aversion to the policies of the left-leaning president, Moon Jae-in, is perhaps not surprising. But in recent months a spate of disappointing employment data and loud protests from businesses have stirred unease within the government. The finance minister, for one, has sounded surprisingly equivocal about the increases.
Cho imho来自韩国保守主义的巢穴大邱，以右翼分子而自豪。他对左倾总统文在寅(Moon Jae-in)政策的厌恶或许并不令人意外。但最近几个月，一连串令人失望的就业数据和来自企业的强烈抗议，在政府内部引发了不安。例如，财政部长对提高最低工资的态度出人意料地模棱两可。

Mr Moon has pledged to stick to his strategy of “income-led growth”, which remains popular with voters. But he now says that the minimum wage will not rise as quickly as originally planned. He also demoted Hong Jang-pyo, an adviser who was one of the policy’s architects. Some observers believe that Chang Ha-sung, his chief of staff for policy and the other main advocate of income-led growth, may be next to go. “There are tensions between the committed reformers and those who are worried about political backlash,” says Jun Sung-in of Hongik University in Seoul. “Currently, the worriers are winning.”
文在寅承诺将坚持他的“收入导向型增长”策略，这一策略在选民中仍很受欢迎。但他现在表示最低工资涨幅不会像最初计划的那样快。他还将政策制定者之一的顾问洪相杓降职。一些观察人士认为，他的政策幕僚长、另一位主要的收入导向型增长倡导者张成泽(Chang Ha-sung)可能是下一个下台的人选。首尔弘益大学(Hongik University)的Jun Sung-in表示:“坚定的改革者和那些担心政治反弹的人之间存在紧张关系。现在担忧者领先。”

Small wonder: according to South Korea’s statistics agency, the income of the lowest 20% of earners fell by 3.7% in the second quarter of this year compared with the same period last year (for high earners, it rose by 12.4%). That suggests that job losses have more than offset increased wages among those whom the policy is intended to help. There has certainly been no spurt in the growth rate, which continues to hover around 3%.
这不足为奇:根据韩国统计局的数据，今年第二季度，收入最低的20%人群的收入与去年同期相比下降了3.7%(对于高收入者来说，上升了12.4%)。这表明，就业岗位的减少远远抵消了该政策旨在帮助的那些人增加的工资。毫无疑问，增长率并没有突飞猛进，继续徘徊在3%左右。

It is not obvious, however, that the increase in the minimum wage is to blame for the disappointing data. There are other potential culprits: uncertainty resulting from the trade war between America and China, worries earlier this year about South Korea’s own free trade agreement with the United States and the slowdown in construction as a result of tighter mortgage-lending rules. Still, the sudden increase may have tipped the scales.
然而，目前还不清楚最低工资标准的提高是否应该对这些令人失望的数据负责。还有其他潜在的罪魁祸首:中美贸易战带来的不确定性，今年早些时候对韩国与美国的自由贸易协定的担忧，以及抵押贷款规定收紧导致的建筑业放缓。还有，突然上涨的最低工资可能已经使天平倾斜。

The thrust of Mr Moon’s reforms, which seek to boost innovation and productivity at smaller firms, is broadly right. The labour market suffers from extreme polarisation between big conglomerates, called chaebol, and most other employers. The chaebol offer the most coveted jobs, but most South Koreans are employed in small firms. Productivity in such businesses, which are concentrated in the service sector, is vastly lower than in the chaebol—hence the huge gap in wages (see chart). Wages for the bottom 10% of earners have barely risen over the past two decades.
文在寅的改革旨在促进小公司的创新和生产力，其主旨大体上是正确的。被称为财阀(chaebol)的大企业集团与大多数其他雇主之间的两极分化，令劳动力市场备受煎熬。财阀提供了最令人垂涎的工作，但大多数韩国人都在小公司工作。这些集中在服务业的企业的生产率远远低于财阀，因此工资差距巨大。在过去的20年里，最低10%的劳动者的工资几乎没有上涨。

Next year’s budget envisions a 10% jump in overall expenditure, with more than a third of the extra money earmarked for social spending. The basic pension will rise, there will be more funding for childcare and small firms that hire young people will receive a subsidy. A recent report by the OECD, a club mostly of rich countries, says these measures are affordable. At 45% of GDP South Korea’s public debt is less than half the OECD average of 110%. It also spends far less on social services than most other OECD countries.
明年的预算支出将增加10%，其中超过三分之一的额外资金将用于社会支出。基本养老金将会增加，有更多的资金用于儿童保育，雇佣年轻人的小企业将会得到补贴。经合组织(OECD)最近的一份报告称，这些措施是可以承受的。韩国的公共债务占GDP的45%，不到经合组织平均水平110的一半。与大多数其他经合组织国家相比，韩国在社会服务方面的支出也要少得多。

But some of the reforms may be counterproductive. The complex array of subsidies intended to help small businesses implement the minimum wage and to encourage them to hire more workers, for instance, may help boost the purchasing power of poorer South Koreans. But it may also prop up barely profitable “zombie companies”, keeping workers in marginal jobs and so undermining efforts to raise productivity.
但有些改革可能适得其反。例如，旨在帮助小企业实施最低工资标准并鼓励它们雇佣更多工人的复杂补贴，可能有助于提高较贫穷的韩国人的购买力。但它也可能支撑着几乎无利可图的“僵尸企业”，让工人留在边缘岗位，从而削弱提高生产率的努力。

Mr Moon has also pledged to “democratise” the economy, by which he means reduce the dominance of the chaebol. Despite much such talk from past governments, however, the assets of the five biggest have grown from the equivalent of 41% of GDP in 2001 to 60% last year, according to Park Sangin of Seoul National University. In other words, they are growing much faster than the economy as a whole.
文在寅还承诺要“民主化”经济，他的意思是削弱财阀的主导地位。然而，据首尔国立大学的朴生贤(Park Sangin)说，尽管历届政府都在大谈特谈，但五大财阀的资产已经从2001年占GDP的41%增长到了去年的60%。换句话说，它们的增长速度远远快于整体经济。

Yet Kim Sang-jo, whom Mr Moon appointed to head the trust-busting Fair Trade Commission, has softened his rhetoric. He appears to be relying more on co-operation from the chaebol than on regulation or lawsuits to unravel their complex and opaque ownership structures. In September Mr Moon took chaebol bosses, including several who have served time for corruption, on a chummy trip to North Korea to advertise the potential for investment, should the North abandon its nuclear weapons. “All our governments have ended up making policy for the chaebol in the end,” says Mr Jun of Hongik University. “It looks like Moon will be no different.”
然而，被文在寅任命为反垄断公平贸易委员会(Fair Trade Commission)主席的金相早(Kim Sang-jo)软化了措辞。他似乎更多地依赖于财阀的合作，而非监管或诉讼，以解开其复杂而不透明的所有权结构。今年9月，文在寅带着财阀老板(包括几名曾因腐败而服刑的高管)到朝鲜进行亲密访问，宣传如果朝鲜放弃核武器，可能会投资。弘益大学的Jun Sung-in先生说:“我们所有的政府最终都是为财阀制定政策。看起来文在寅也不会有什么不同。”

A third strand of Mr Moon’s reforms, to chip away at a culture of absurdly long working hours and encourage more spending on fun, is also yielding mixed results. A new presidential directive limits the maximum number of hours a week that people are allowed to work at 52, down from 68. This month a study by kt, a telecoms firm, suggested that leisure spending went up in residential areas after the directive came into force.
文在寅的第三条改革措施，即减少荒谬的长时间工作的文化，鼓励更多的娱乐消费，也产生了喜忧参半的结果。一项新的总统指令限制了每周工作时间的上限，从68小时降至52小时。本月电信公司kt的一项研究表明，在该指令生效后，居民区的休闲支出增加了。

The amount of time people spent in or near their workplace, in contrast, fell by 55 minutes a day. This suggests that the policy is working as intended, with one important caveat. kt only detected this shift in central Seoul, where most ministries and big companies are based. In areas dominated by startups and smaller firms, there was little or no decrease in working hours. And a downside of the directive was also discernible: bars and restaurants in central Seoul reported a loss in business. Reshaping the South Korean economy for the little guy turns out to be a big challenge.
相比之下，人们在工作场所或附近花费的时间减少了55分钟。这表明，该政策正在按计划实施，但有一个重要的提醒。韩国电信只是在首尔市中心发现了这种转变，首尔大部分部委和大公司都位于市中心。在初创企业和小企业占主导地位的领域，工作时间几乎没有或根本没有减少。该指令的一个不利方面也显而易见:首尔市中心的酒吧和餐馆出现了业务亏损。对普通老百姓来说，重塑韩国经济是一个巨大的挑战。

结构分析：
改革措施主要三条，一是提高最低工资标准和增加社会福利支出，二是限制大财阀和扶植小企业和创新企业，三是限制每周工作小时数的上限。
