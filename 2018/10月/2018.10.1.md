##Carrefour adds to the intrigue around a rival French grocer
IS IT possible to reject a takeover bid that has not been made? Such ontological questions rarely bother mergers-and-acquisitions bankers. France is different. At around midnight on September 23rd Casino, a supermarket chain, said its board of directors had unanimously rejected a hostile takeover attempt by Carrefour, a bigger rival. By sunrise, the supposed bidder insisted it had made no such offer. Investors have been left scratching their heads in the manner of undergraduates grappling with the tenets of existentialism.

Whether a merger is in the works remains unclear. Carrefour might have sniffed an opportunity in the travails of Casino, part of the empire of Jean-Charles Naouri, a well-connected former civil servant and mathematician. His shops, which include the upscale Monoprix chain, are well run. But the firm is heavily indebted, and sits at the bottom of a cascade of listed firms also saddled with loans. Concerns over the health of its balance-sheet have prompted Casino’s shares to drop by nearly 30% since the start of the year.

On September 3rd S&P Global, a ratings agency, cut Casino’s credit rating further into junk territory when a key subsidiary was late filing its accounts. Analysts have been struggling for months to make sense of its books. Casino denies impropriety and has blamed the share-price drop on hedge funds betting on the downfall of one of the pillars of the Naouri empire.

Markets have also focused on Rallye, another listed firm run by Mr Naouri, which owns just over half of Casino. A large part of its borrowings, which reached €2.9bn ($3.4bn) in June, use its shareholding in Casino as collateral. Given the share-price plunge, the collateral available shrank, increasing pressure on Casino to remit money to Rallye lest it default. That in turn would have harmed Casino’s prospects, so causing its share price to fall further, and so prompting Rallye to ask for more cash from Casino, and so on.
