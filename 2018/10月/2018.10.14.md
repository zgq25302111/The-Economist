##America has often come first—but its dream has shrunk
IT IS common for historians to examine the actions of great men. Sarah Churchwell, a professor of American literature at the University of London, does something different. Her protagonists are not people but two expressions: “the American dream” and “America first”. By tracking their usage down the years in newspapers, books and politicians’ speeches, her aim is to cast light not just on the country’s past but also on its politics today. President Donald Trump launched his bid for the White House proclaiming that “the American dream is dead”; he has used “America first” as a rallying cry.
1. the most important character in a play, film, or story;
one of the most important people taking part in a competition, battle, or struggle;
one of the most important supporters of a social or political idea.
2. 历史学家研究伟人的行为是很常见的。伦敦大学的美国文学教授Sarah Churchwell与此不同。她的主人公不是人，而是两个表达：“美国梦”和“美国优先”。通过追踪这两个表达在经年累月的报纸、书籍和政客们的演讲中的使用情况，她的目标是不仅要关照美国的过去，还要关照今天的政治。美国总统唐纳德•特朗普竞选总统时宣称“美国梦已死”;他把“美国优先”作为竞选口号。

Both phrases are about a century old and have had a richer and more varied life than is commonly realised. The American dream nowadays tends to evoke individuals’ pursuit of riches, Ms Churchwell argues, but it started out in the Progressive Era meaning almost the opposite: “the social dream of justice and equality against individual dreams of aspiration and personal success”. After that, each successive period invented its own American dream according to the prevailing conditions.
1. progressive era:The Progressive Era is a period of widespread social activism and political reform across the United States that spanned from the 1890s to the 1920s. The main objectives of the Progressive movement were eliminating problems caused by industrialization, urbanization, immigration, and corruption in government.
2. 这两个短语都有一个世纪的历史，并且拥有比人们通常意识到的更丰富、更多样的经历。“如今的美国梦往往会唤起个人对财富的追求，”Sarah Churchwell认为，“但它始于进步时代，意思几乎是相反的：“正义与平等的社会梦想，而不是个人成功的梦想”。在那之后，每一个相继的时期都根据当时的情况赋予美国梦新的含义。

For the first 20 years the expression mainly had a political, not an economic meaning. But from the mid-1920s it took on a familiar ring, and in the 1930s, against the background of the Depression, its use exploded as it came to describe what one of its champions, the historian James Truslow Adams, called “that belief in the right and possibility of a better life for all, regardless of class or circumstance”. By the 1950s and the advent of the cold war, says Ms Churchwell, the dream “had shrugged off all sense of moral disquiet, becoming a triumphalist patriotic assertion”.
1. have a familiar ring:if something has a familiar ring, you feel that you have heard it before
His voice had a strangely familiar ring. 他的声音听起来不可思议地耳熟。
2. triumphalist:必胜主义者；必胜信念者
3. assertion:something that you say or write that you strongly believe
the assertion that house prices are falling
房价在下跌的断言
4. 在最初的20年里，这个表达（美国梦）主要是有政治而不是经济意义。但从1920年代中期开始它听起来耳熟。在1930年代大萧条的背景下,其被爆炸性地用来描述“对民权和所有人更好生活的可能性的信念，无论阶级或环境如何”。这是这一时期的旗手和主将之一历史学家James Truslow Adams所说的。“到20世纪50年代和冷战时期，”Churchwell女士写到，美国梦“摆脱了所有的道德不安感，成为一种必胜信念者的爱国主义主张”。
5. James Truslow Adams (October 18, 1878 – May 18, 1949) was an American writer and historian. He was a freelance author who helped to popularize the latest scholarship about American history and his three-volume history of New England is well regarded by scholars.
6. Adams coined the term "American Dream" in his 1931 book The Epic of America. His American Dream is "that dream of a land in which life should be better and richer and fuller for everyone, with opportunity for each according to ability or achievement. It is a difficult dream for the European upper classes to interpret adequately, and too many of us ourselves have grown weary and mistrustful of it. It is not a dream of motor cars and high wages merely, but a dream of social order in which each man and each woman shall be able to attain to the fullest stature of which they are innately capable, and be recognized by others for what they are, regardless of the fortuitous circumstances of birth or position."
