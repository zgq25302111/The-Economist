##London’s financial flows are polluted by laundered money
BRITAIN likes to see itself as a leader in the fight against illicit finance and corruption. The government has recently been talking even tougher, as worsening relations with Russia have focused attention on the number of oligarchs who have interests in London. Anyone looking to stash dirty money “should be in no doubt that we will come for them,” warns Ben Wallace, the economic-crime minister.
1. stash:to store something secretly or safely somewhere

In fact the record suggests that wrongdoers can sleep easy. The National Crime Agency (NCA) reckons that “many hundreds of billions of pounds” of international money is rinsed through British banks each year, much of it from kleptocrats and their cronies. Almost every big cross-border corruption case in recent years has had a connection to Britain or its palm-fringed overseas territories. British limited-liability partnerships were the vehicle of choice for suspicious clients of Danske Bank, which is embroiled in the laundering of as much as €200bn ($230bn).
1. rinse:to wash clothes, dishes, vegetables etc quickly with water, especially running water, and without soap
2. kleptocrat:贪官污吏
3. embroil:to involve someone or something in a difficult situation
The Times continues to clamour for the nation to range itself beside Russia and France, and to embroil itself in the great continental war that is arising before us.
泰晤士报仍在呼吁政府与俄、法并肩作战，加入到眼前这场欧洲大陆上的大战中。
On the other hand, marrying an affluent "phoenix man" might embroil the woman in endless troubles with his extended family.
另一方面，如果嫁一个富裕的凤凰男，则可能是让自己卷入和他家庭无尽的纠纷当中。

Some people in the governing Conservative Party and the City argue that a big clean-up would be harmful just when British finance risks losing its lustre because of Brexit. The more important point is that, in a country which has undergone bail-outs and austerity following the financial crisis of 2008, doing nothing to tackle dirty capital flows could further undermine the legitimacy of capitalism.
1. undergo:if you undergo a change, an unpleasant experience etc, it happens to you or is done to you
The country has undergone massive changes recently. 
这个国家最近经历了巨大的变化。
He has been released from prison to undergo medical treatment in the United States. 
他获释出狱去美国接受治疗。
2. bail-outs and austerity:救市和紧缩
3. undermine:to gradually make someone or something less strong or effective
economic policies that threaten to undermine the health care system
可能会损害医疗保健制度的经济政策
undermine sb’s confidence/authority/position/credibility etc
The constant criticism was beginning to undermine her confidence.

Thames and misdemeanours
London is hardly unique. Other financial centres, including New York, Dubai and Singapore, also wash dodgy cash. The more clean money sloshes around, the easier it is to hide the dirty sort.*[1]But London has exceptionally enticing attributes. It handles vast cross-border capital flows. It boasts the English language, good schools and, ironically, a respected legal system (which shields tycoons against the arbitrary plunder they suffer at home). Relaxed rules on ownership are geared towards rich foreigners. Armies of lawyers and public-relations firms specialise in rinsing reputations. Tough libel laws help keep prying journalists and NGOs at bay. On top of all this, Britain has its own network of secretive offshore territories, dubbed its “second empire” by anti-corruption campaigners. London is, in short, ideal for money-laundering.*
1. slosh:if a liquid sloshes somewhere, or if you slosh it, it moves or is moved about in an uncontrolled way
Water was sloshing about in the bottom of the boat. 
水在船底哗啦哗啦地荡漾。
2. plunder:to steal large amounts of money or property from somewhere, especially while fighting in a war
The rich provinces of Asia Minor were plundered by the invaders. 
小亚细亚的富饶地区遭到侵略者的劫掠。
Unlicensed fishermen have plundered tuna stocks. 
无证渔民滥捕金枪鱼。
3. [1]但伦敦有着格外诱人的特质。它处理大量的跨境资本流动。它有引以为傲的英语语言、良好的学校教育，具有讽刺意味的完善的法律体系(该体系保护企业大亨免受他们在国内遭受的任意掠夺)。放松的所有权规则是针对富有的外国人的。大批律师和公关公司专门从事洗刷污名的工作。严厉的诽谤法有助于阻止记者和非政府组织的窥探。除此之外，英国还有自己的秘密海外领土网络，被反腐败人士称为“第二帝国”。简而言之，伦敦是洗钱的理想之地。
