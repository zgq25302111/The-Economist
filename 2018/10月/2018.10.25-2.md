Hardware is hard. The electronics-industry adage applies not only to making ever more complex devices but also to selling them at a good price. Even inventive firms fail to ward off commoditisation. Will Sonos, a maker of wireless speakers that went public in August at a value of just under $1.5bn, escape this fate? It is a test case of whether smaller firms can still compete with the giants.

做硬件很难。这句电子行业的格言不仅适用于制造更复杂的设备，也适用于以较好的价格销售。即使是有创造力的公司也无法避免商品趋同化。今年8月上市的无线扬声器制造商Sonos的市值略低于15亿美元，它能逃脱这种命运吗?这是一个小公司是否还能与大公司竞争的案例。

Founded 16 years ago in Santa Barbara, five hours’ drive south of Silicon Valley, the firm(Sonos)’s elegant devices have attracted a loyal following of over 7m households. Many of them still use the speakers they bought years ago and buy new ones on top (nearly two-fifths of buyers already own a Sonos). Yet their most appealing feature is neither design nor longevity, but software. Sonos was the first to make wireless speakers that are easy to set up, even across multiple rooms. And it often upgrades its products with new features over the internet.

Sonos公司16年前成立于距离硅谷以南5小时车程的圣巴巴拉，该公司的优雅的设备吸引了超过700万家庭的忠实拥趸。他们中的许多人仍然使用他们几年前买的音箱，并购买最新的配置。然而，它们最吸引人的特性既不是设计，也不是寿命，而是软件。Sonos是第一个制造可以横跨多个房间且易于安装的无线扬声器的公司。它经常通过互联网升级软件为产品增加新的特性。

For years Sonos had the market largely to itself, until the rise of smart speakers—wireless audio devices complete with a digital assistant that obeys voice commands. Nearly 100m of these have been sold, mostly by Amazon and Google. They are often no match for Sonos on sound quality but they do compete on service and price, says Ben Wood of ccs Insight, a market-research firm. Amazon’s Echo Dot or Google’s Home Mini start at $39.99 and $49 respectively, compared with $150 for Sonos’s cheapest speaker. And the tech giants’ products are getting better. Amazon now offers a wireless amplifier that powers conventional high-end speakers. As for Apple, its HomePod already competes directly with Sonos.

多年来，Sonos在市场上独领风骚，直到智能扬声器--带有能执行声音指令的数字助手的无线音频设备--的兴起。已经销售了几乎一亿部的智能扬声器，大部分来自亚马逊和谷歌。市场研究公司ccs Insight的本•伍德(Ben Wood)表示，它们在音质上通常无法与Sonos匹敌，但在服务和价格上确实存在竞争。亚马逊的Echo Dot或谷歌的家庭迷你的售价分别是39.99美元和49美元起，而Sonos最便宜的扬声器售价为150美元。科技巨头的产品也越来越好。亚马逊现在为传统高端扬声器提供了无线放大器。至于苹果，其HomePod已经直接与Sonos竞争。

Sonos could react by selling cheaper speakers. But Amazon and Google can easily beat it at this game. They could offer their devices at or even below cost, since these are principally vehicles to spread digital assistants, which will eventually help the two firms earn more from their main e-commerce and advertising businesses. Sonos has instead opted to build on its existing strengths, says Patrick Spence, its boss.

Sonos可以通过出售更便宜的扬声器做出反应。但是亚马逊和谷歌可以轻松击败它。他们可以成本价甚至低于成本的价格销售智能扬声器，因为这主要是推广数字助手的工具，数字助手最终将帮助两家公司从他们的主营业务电子商务和广告业务中赚取更多利润。Sonos的老板Patrick Spence说，Sonos选择加强自己的优势（加长长板而不是补短板）。

One of these is high-end hardware. The firm has already developed devices in new forms, such as a sound bar and a television sound system. It is working with IKEA, a big furniture chain, on ways to integrate speakers into its products.

其中之一就是高端硬件。该公司已经开发出了一些新型设备，如声条和电视音响系统。该公司正与大型家具连锁企业宜家(IKEA)合作，设法将扬声器融入其产品中。

But Sonos’s bigger goal is to turn its software into a platform—a “Switzerland for audio services”, in the words of Mr Spence. Its products are equipped with a direct link to 60 music-streaming services, including Deezer and Spotify. It aims to repeat the trick by incorporating digital assistants: Amazon’s Alexa is already listening; Google’s Assistant is soon to come; others could follow. The firm may even introduce its own virtual butler, which would specialise in music-related commands. Outside developers can now write programs for Sonos’s platform—connecting it to a wireless doorbell or other smart-home devices, for example.

但用Spence先生的话说，Sonos更大的目标是把软件发展成平台--瑞士音频服务。它的产品与包括Deezer和Spotify在内的60家音乐流媒体服务直连。它的目标是通过整合数字助手来重复这个策略：亚马逊的Alexa已经跟Sonos有合作；谷歌助手也在路上；其他厂家跟随。该公司甚至可能推出自己的虚拟管家，专门负责音乐相关指令。例如，外部开发人员现在可以为Sonos平台编写程序，将其连接到无线门铃或其他智能家居设备。

Investors are not yet persuaded. Sonos’s shares have fallen by 13% since its listing. The competition is fierce: Amazon is particularly aggressive on price. According to Mr Wood, Sonos will need to show that it can deal with the programming complexity that comes with being a platform without being able to tap a talent pool like Silicon Valley’s. One test of success will be if it can grow at least as fast as music-streaming, which Sanford C. Bernstein, a research firm, predicts will expand by more than a third over the next three years.

投资者还没有被说服。Sonos的股价自上市以来已经下跌了13%。竞争非常激烈:亚马逊在价格上尤其咄咄逼人。伍德表示，Sonos将需要证明它能够应对平台所带来的编程复杂性，同时又不能利用硅谷那样的人才库。Sonos是否能成功要看它是否能像音乐流媒体那样快速增长，市场研究公司Sanford C. Bernstein预测音乐流媒体未来三年内将会增长超过三分之一。

Sonos does have one big advantage. As a pioneer of wireless speakers, it has amassed a lot of patents. Its website lists nearly 700, including ones for how music can be streamed to speakers and how these can be tuned to the acoustics of the room they are in. IEEE Spectrum, a magazine, has ranked the portfolio the second strongest in the electronics industry, behind Apple’s. Sonos has already won an infringement case against Denon Electronics, another maker of wireless speakers. It has reportedly allowed Google to use its intellectual property in return for making Assistant available on its devices. Such behaviour recalls some of the tech giants’ own tactics, using one asset to gain an edge for others. With such huge rivals closing in, Sonos is wise to copy a few of their tricks.

Sonos确实有一个很大的优势。作为无线扬声器的先驱，它已经积累了很多专利。该公司的网站列出了近700个专利，其中包括如何将音乐串流到扬声器中，以及如何将这些音乐调音到他们所在房间的音响效果中。《IEEE Spectrum》杂志将Sonos公司的专利组合列为电子行业第二强，仅次于苹果(Apple)。Sonos已经在针对另一家无线扬声器制造商Denon electronics的侵权诉讼中胜诉。据报道，Sonos允许谷歌使用其知识产权，以换取在Sonos设备上使用Google助手。这种方式让人想起一些科技巨头自己的策略，使用自己的优势资源换取别人的优势资源。随着如此巨大的竞争对手的逼近，Sonos明智地模仿了他们的一些技巧。
