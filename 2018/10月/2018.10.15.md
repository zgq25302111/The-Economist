##THE National Security Strategy augured a major change in China-US relations
THE National Security Strategy released by President Donald Trump’s administration last year augured a major change in China-US relations. Where its predecessors lauded the merits of co-operation with the emerging superpower, Mr Trump’s document promised competition and resistance to Chinese trade and other abuses. The tirade Mike Pence launched against China last week doubled down on that commitment. In a speech delivered at the Hudson Institute, a short walk from Congress and the ongoing Kavanaugh brouhaha, the vice-president castigated the Chinese for bullying investors, buying allies with cheap loans, “tearing down crosses” and much else. This may turn out to be Mr Trump’s most significant mark on the world. America’s new adversarial posture towards China is overdue, popular and probably irreversible.

5. 唐纳德•特朗普政府去年发布的国家安全战略预示着中美关系将发生重大变化。当前几届总统称赞与新兴超级大国合作的好处时，川普总统的国家安全战略承诺对中国贸易和其他滥用行为进行竞争和抵制。迈克•彭斯上周针对中国的长篇演讲更强调了这一点。在哈德逊研究所发表的一篇演讲中，副总统迈克•彭斯严厉斥责了中国对投资者的欺凌，用廉价的贷款收买盟友，拆除基督教堂，还有其他许多事情。这可能是特朗普在世界上最为显著的影响。美国对中国的新的对抗姿态早该发生了，很受欢迎，很可能不可逆转。

That is notwithstanding the fact that the vice-president’s speech was in some ways cynical and reckless. Much of it seemed to have more of an eye on the mid-terms than the world. “To put it bluntly, President Trump’s leadership is working,” he purred. Mr Pence then parroted his boss’s recent, probably bogus, claim that Chinese “covert actors, front groups and propaganda” were spreading more disinformation in America than the Russian spies to whom Mr Trump may owe his job. He gave no sense of which Chinese affronts he considered most grievous. He therefore offered only a glint of a counter-strategy. It was disorientating to witness such tawdry politics at such a potentially momentous moment. Conversely, it was a useful reminder, in Trump-drunk Washington, DC, that some things are bigger than Mr Trump.
