Tesla reported a surprise, and rare, quarterly profit, of $312m. The electric-car maker also pleased its dogged investors by improving its cashflow, which bolsters its argument that it doesn’t need to turn to the markets to raise funds. Its Model 3 was the best-selling car in America by revenue and the fifth by volume. With its usual gift for understatement, Tesla described the quarter as “truly historic”.

Tesla公布季度盈利3.12亿美元，这是出人意料的和罕见的。这家电动汽车制造商还通过改善现金流来取悦其坚定的投资者，这也增强了它不需要向市场融资的说服力。Model 3按收入算是美国最畅销的汽车，销量排名第五。一向以低调行事著称的Tesla称他们在该季度创造了历史。

Stockmarkets had another rocky week. The NASDAQ index recorded its biggest one-day decline in more than seven years and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell below the level at which it started the year. A co-ordinated confidence-boosting effort by senior government officials in China pledging support for markets helped its stockmarkets chalk up their biggest single-day gains in almost three years. But the positive sentiment soon evaporated. 

股市又经历了动荡的一周。纳斯达克指数创下了7年多来的最大单日跌幅，道琼斯工业平均指数也跌破了年初的水平。中国政府高级官员承诺支持市场，这一协调的提振信心的举措帮助中国股市创下近三年来单日最大涨幅。但这种积极情绪很快就消失了。

The tiger’s tail
China’s economy grew by 6.5% in the third quarter, year on year. That was the slowest pace since early 2009, in the depth of the financial crisis. The figure does not yet fully reflect the trade war with America, because the largest portion of tariffs imposed on Chinese exports came into effect only in late September. More penalties are due to be implemented in January.

中国经济第三季度同比增长6.5%。这是自2009年初金融危机最严重时期以来的最低增速。这个数字还没有完全反映出中美之间的贸易战，因为对中国出口产品征收的最大关税直到9月底才开始生效。更多的处罚将于明年1月实施。

Deutsche Bank released disappointing quarterly earnings. The German bank recorded sharp declines in sales and trading revenue compared with the same three months last year, a contrast to the increased income reported by American investment banks. Net profit fell by 65%, to €229m ($266m). Christian Sewing, who took over as chief executive in April, insisted that the bank would make its first annual profit since 2014.

德意志银行公布了令人失望的季报。与去年同期相比，这家德国银行的销售和交易收入大幅下滑，与美国投行报告的收入增长形成鲜明对比。净利润下降了65%,为€2.29亿(合266亿美元)。今年4月接任首席执行官的克里斯蒂安•普钦(Christian sew)坚称，该行将自2014年以来首次实现年度盈利。

The state of New York filed a lawsuit against ExxonMobil, claiming that it misled investors about the risk that regulations on climate change posed to its business. The suit alleges that the oil company “built a façade to deceive” how it measured the risk and frequently did not apply the “proxy cost” of carbon, which accounts for expected future events, to its decisions.

纽约州对埃克森美孚(ExxonMobil)提起诉讼，称其在气候变化法规对其业务构成的风险方面误导了投资者。指控称，这家石油公司制造假象以蒙蔽它怎么处置风险，并且常常不将碳的代理成本(未来可能发生的事件有影响)应用到自己的决策中。

A judge in California slashed the amount in total damages—from $289m to $78m—awarded by a jury to a school groundsman who claims his cancer was caused by Roundup, a weedkiller made by Monsanto. But the judge refused to order a retrial, a blow to Bayer, the German chemical conglomerate that took over Monsanto this year. Bayer’s share price swooned after the ruling. It is to appeal against the decision.

加州一名法官将赔偿金总额从2.89亿美元大幅削减至7800万美元。陪审团判定，一名学校管理人员声称自己的癌症是由孟山都公司生产的除草剂农达引起的。但法官拒绝下令重审，这对今年收购孟山都的德国化工集团拜耳(Bayer)是一个打击。判决公布后，拜耳的股价暴跌。这是反对该判决的申诉。

PR offensive
Facebook appointed Sir Nick Clegg as its new head of global affairs. The former British deputy prime minister said he wanted “to build bridges between politics and tech”, which will involve a lot of shuffling between Silicon Valley, Washington and Brussels. Some hope he has better luck in the job than as leader of the Liberal Democrats, who saw their support collapse after he reneged on a promise not to increase university tuition fees.

Facebook任命尼克•克莱格爵士(Sir Nick Clegg)为其新任全球事务主管。这位英国前副首相表示，他希望“在政治和科技之间架起一座桥梁”，这将涉及硅谷、华盛顿和布鲁塞尔之间的许多事务。一些人希望他在这个职位上比作为自由民主党的领袖有更好的运气。在他违背了不增加大学学费的承诺后，自由民主党的支持率暴跌。

Hoping it can overcome a costly industrial dispute that has helped wipe 40% off its market value this year, Air France- klm signed a pay deal with three-quarters of its staff, which meets a threshold for the agreement to become binding and implemented. Although the main pilots’ union withheld its support, the deal is a significant success for Ben Smith, the airline’s new Canadian chief executive.

法航荷航集团希望能够克服一场代价高昂的劳资纠纷，今年这场纠纷已导致其市值缩水40%。法航荷航集团与四分之三的员工签署了一份薪酬协议，该协议达到了生效和实施的门槛。尽管主要飞行员工会拒绝提供支持，但该交易对该航空公司新任的加拿大籍首席执行官本•史密斯(Ben Smith)来说是一个重大成功。

Also hit by a wave of strikes this year, Ryanair said its pre-tax profit fell by 9% in the six months to September 30th, to €1.3bn ($1.5bn). Europe’s biggest low-cost airline has had to contend with the rising price of oil. Despite heavy hedging, its fuel costs were up by a fifth.

今年也受到罢工的影响，瑞安航空表示今年二三季度税前利润下降了9%，税前利润为13亿欧元，合15亿美元。欧洲最大的廉价航空公司不得不应对油价上涨。尽管进行了大量的对冲操作，其燃料成本仍上升了五分之一。

For the defence
at&t lost a further 346,000 video subscribers in the latest quarter. The migration of satellite-tv customers to online-streaming broadcasters, such as Netflix, was the rationale behind at&t’s takeover of Time Warner (since rebranded as WarnerMedia). That business reported a rise in sales in the quarter to $8.2bn, boosted by blockbuster films such as “Crazy Rich Asians”.

最近一个季度AT&T又失去了34.6万视频用户。AT&T收购时代华纳(Time Warner)的根本原因是卫星电视用户转向Netflix等在线流媒体广播公司。该公司报告在《摘金奇缘》等大片的推动下，该季度销售额增长至82亿美元。

Dyson, a British manufacturer best known for its cordless vacuum-cleaners, selected Singapore as the site for a new factory in its expansion into electric vehicles. The company stressed that its choice had nothing to do with Brexit. Sir James Dyson, the company’s founder and a strong supporter of Brexit, once described the idea that no one would trade with Britain once it left the EU as “absolute cobblers”.

以无绳吸尘器闻名的英国制造商Dyson在向电动汽车领域扩张中选择新加坡作为新工厂的选址。该公司强调该选择与英国脱欧无关。该公司创始人和英国脱欧的坚定支持者詹姆斯•戴森爵士(Sir James Dyson)曾表示一旦英国脱欧就没人与英国贸易的说法纯粹是胡扯。
