##Business this week
Stockmarkets around the world tumbled. Investors were spooked by a number of factors, including fears that trade tensions between America and China were starting to hurt profits, especially at technology companies. Apple’s share price dropped by 4.6% in one day. Asian markets fared particularly badly. The Shanghai Composite fell by 5.2% on a single day to near a four-year low. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng and Tokyo’s Topix index recorded similar plunges.

Although Chicago has fared better than some cities, unemployment remains a problem. 
虽说芝加哥比其他一些城市情况好些，但失业仍是个问题。
He wondered how Ed had fared in the interview. 
他想知道埃德面试情况如何。
2. 全球股票市场一片萧条。由于对包括中美贸易战减少企业利润等问题的担忧，投资者被吓坏了，特别是对于科技公司。苹果公司股票一年下跌4.6%。亚州股市损失更为惨重。上证综指一天下跌5.2%，创4年来新低。香港恒生指数和东证股价指数也是类似的暴跌。

China’s central bank pumped 750bn yuan ($108bn) into the economy by reducing the amount of cash that banks have to hold as reserves, after figures showed that investment and exports have weakened. The trade war with America, which has raised tariffs on Chinese imports, and a strong dollar have increased the pressure on policymakers to bolster growth.
1. 数据显示投资和出口减弱，因此中国央行降低准备金率1个百分点，向市场释放增量资金7500亿元人民币。中美贸易战抬高中国进口商品的关税，而美元走强也加大了政策制定者提振经济增长的压力。

Google faced more pressure following the news that it had failed to disclose a bug in its Google+ social network. The company discovered in March that the personal details of up to 500,000 users may have been exposed to developers of third-party apps. It will shut down Google+, though that did little to stop observers comparing the transgression to Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica scandal.
1. 谷歌未能披露谷歌+社交网络的一个bug，受此消息影响，谷歌面临更大的压力。谷歌今年3月发现高达50万用户的个人信息可能已经暴露给第三方APP开发者。它将关闭谷歌+，不过这并不能阻止观察人士将这一违法行为与Facebook的剑桥分析丑闻相提并论。

Just a week after settling with the Securities and Exchange Commission over the tweets he published claiming he would take Tesla private, Elon Musk courted more controversy by describing the regulator as the “Shortseller Enrichment Commission”. David Einhorn, a prominent short-seller of the electric-carmaker’s stock, said Mr Musk’s erratic behaviour risked turning the company into another Lehman Brothers. The company’s share price dropped to its lowest level in 18 months. 
1. erratic:something that is erratic does not follow any pattern or plan but happens in a way that is not regular
His breathing was becoming erratic.

2. 就在与美国证券交易委员会关于发布推文公开宣称私有化Tesla这件事达成和解的一周后，埃隆•马斯克将该监管机构形容为“卖空者充斥的委员会”，从而引发了更多的争议。电动汽车股的知名卖空者戴维•艾因霍恩表示，马斯克的不稳定行为有可能使该公司变成另一个雷曼兄弟。该公司的股价跌至18个月以来的最低水平。
