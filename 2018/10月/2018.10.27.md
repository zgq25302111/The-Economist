Some 7,000 Central American migrants travelling together towards America entered Mexico from Guatemala, despite an attempt by Mexican police to stop them. The “caravan” originated in the Honduran city of San Pedro Sula and grew as it progressed. President Donald Trump suggested, without evidence, that the Democrats had a hand in organising it and that “criminals and unknown Middle Easterners” are part of the group. America’s mid-term elections are on November 6th.

尽管墨西哥警方试图阻止，大约7 000名中美洲移民一起从危地马拉进入墨西哥前往美国。“大篷车”起源于洪都拉斯的圣佩德罗苏拉，并随着其发展而壮大。Donald Trump在没有证据的情况下表示，民主党参与了此事的组织，“犯罪分子和不知名的中东人”混杂其中。美国中期选举将于11月6日举行。

Julian Assange, a co-founder of WikiLeaks, sued Ecuador, whose embassy in London has given him comfortable refuge since 2012. WikiLeaks accuses Ecuador of blocking his communications. The embassy has also told him to take better care of his cat. Mr Assange originally entered the building to avoid extradition to Sweden to face sexual-assault charges that have since been dropped. He still fears extradition to America for publishing its secrets.

维基解密联合创始人朱利安•阿桑奇(Julian Assange)起诉厄瓜多尔，厄瓜多尔驻伦敦大使馆自2012年以来一直为他提供舒适的庇护。维基解密指控厄瓜多尔封锁了他的通讯。大使馆也告诉他要好好照顾他的猫。阿桑奇最初进入该大楼是为了避免被引渡到瑞典面对性侵犯指控，自那以后指控被撤销了。他仍然担心会因为泄露机密而被引渡到美国。

Arms and the man
Donald Trump announced that America would withdraw from an arms-control treaty with Russia that banishes short- and mid-range nuclear missiles from Europe. The treaty was signed in 1987 by Mikhail Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan. America accuses Russia of developing a missile system that breaks its terms, which Moscow denies. Mr Trump and Vladimir Putin are to meet on November 11th; the topic is sure to come up.

Donald Trump宣布，美国将退出与俄罗斯签署的一项军控条约，该条约禁止从欧洲进口中短程核导弹。该条约由米哈伊尔·戈尔巴乔夫和罗纳德·里根于1987年签署。美国指责俄罗斯开发了违反条约的导弹系统，俄罗斯对此予以否认。Donald Trump和Vladimir Putin将于11月11日会面;这个话题肯定会出现。

The Justice Department filed criminal charges against a woman for her alleged role in a Russian conspiracy to “sow discord” in American elections, including the mid-terms. The woman, based in St Petersburg, is said to be the accountant for a disinformation project backed by a pro-Putin Russian oligarch. It is claimed she disbursed money for activists, advertisements on social media and “promoting news postings on social networks.”

美国司法部(Justice Department)对一名女子提起刑事诉讼，指控她涉嫌参与俄罗斯在包括中期选举在内的美国选举中“挑拨离间”的阴谋。这名女子住在圣彼得堡，据说是一个由亲普京的俄罗斯寡头支持的虚假信息项目的会计。据称，她为活动人士、社交媒体广告以及“在社交网络上推广新闻帖子”提供资金。

The skin of its teeth
Australia’s Liberal Party lost a by-election for a seat in Sydney that had been held by Malcolm Turnbull, who was ousted as prime minister by his party in August. That means the governing coalition has lost its one-seat majority in Parliament and will have to depend on independent mps to survive any vote of no confidence.

澳大利亚自由党(Liberal Party)在悉尼一个席位的补选中失利，这个席位由马尔科姆•特恩布尔(Malcolm Turnbull)把持，他在八月份被他的政党赶下台。这意味着执政联盟在议会中失去了一个席位的多数，将不得不依靠独立的国会议员来度过任何不信任投票。

Afghanistan held its first parliamentary election in eight years. Less than a third of potential voters registered and only half of those turned out, largely for fear of being killed by jihadists. At least 50 people were murdered by the Taliban, which had warned people not to vote. 

阿富汗举行了8年来的第一次议会选举。不到三分之一的潜在选民登记，只有一半的选民参加了投票，主要是因为害怕被圣战分子杀害。至少有50人被塔利班杀害，塔利班曾警告人们不要投票。

越南共产党总书记阮富仲(Nguyen Phu Trong)在宣誓就任新总统时巩固了自己的权力。阮富仲在例行公事的议会中获得99.8%的选票(他是选票上唯一的名字)，是自1960年代胡志明执政以来首位同时担任这两个职位的人。

China’s president, Xi Jinping, opened the world’s longest sea bridge. Costing $20bn, the 55km (34-mile) Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge spans the Pearl river estuary and is part of a government plan to integrate the region’s cities into one giant economic and transport hub.

Who gave the order?
Muhammad bin Salman, the crown prince and effective ruler of Saudi Arabia, distanced himself from the killers of Jamal Khashoggi, after the kingdom at last admitted that he had been murdered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. The killing has harmed Saudi relations with Turkey and prompted Germany to halt arms sales to the country.

在沙特王国最终承认Jamal Khashoggi被害于沙特在伊斯坦布尔的领事馆后，沙特王储和实际领导人Salman撇清了自己和杀害Jamal Khashoggi的凶手的关系。这起暗杀事件损害了沙特与土耳其的关系，并促使德国停止向沙特出售武器。

Heading for a showdown
The European Commission in Brussels rejected Italy’s budget. It calls for a 2.4% deficit this year, which, given the size of Italy’s debt, is not considered sustainable. The Italian government has been given three weeks to revise it, or face sanctions. In Rome, Matteo Salvini, one of the leaders of the populist coalition government, said he would not alter the budget.

布鲁塞尔的欧盟委员会否决了意大利的预算方案。它要求今年的预算赤字为2.4%，考虑到意大利的债务规模，这是不可持续的。意大利政府被限定在三个星期内修改预算，否则将面临制裁。在罗马，民粹主义联合政府领导人之一马泰奥•萨尔维尼(Matteo Salvini)表示，他不会改变预算。

In the biggest demonstration in Britain since the start of the Iraq war, an estimated 700,000 people took to the streets of London to call for a “People’s Vote” on the final Brexit deal. Britain has been divided for two years over the outcome of the referendum to leave the EU. A much less publicised march took place in Harrogate to “save Brexit” and attracted a much smaller crowd.
