##The social network shuts down in disgrace
IT WAS not a good way to go. On October 8th Google said it was closing Google+, a social network that it had launched in 2011.*[1] On the face of it, that hardly matters: Google+ is a ghost town.* Although the network notionally has hundreds of millions of users, Google itself admits that 90% of visits last less than five seconds. Few will miss it. The internet-search and advertising giant plans to resurrect some version of it for internal use in companies.
1. [1]从表面上看，这几乎无关紧要：Google+是一个鬼城。
2. resurrect:to bring back an old activity, belief, idea etc that has not existed for a long time
The Home Office have resurrected plans to build a new prison just outside London. 
内政部重新提出了在伦敦市外建一座监狱的计划。

Less important than the fact of its closure, though, was the manner. The announcement came hours after the Wall Street Journal revealed that, in March, Google had discovered a bug in Google+’s code. Information that around half a million users had marked as private was nevertheless made visible to their friends and through them to more than 400 third-party apps.

Both the nature of the bug and its timing are significant. The bug has echoes of the way in which Cambridge Analytica, a British political-advertising firm, was able to illicitly harvest the data of more than 50m Facebook users in 2014. Those data were used to target advertisements in America’s presidential election and Britain’s referendum on leaving the European Union in 2016. *[2]When the data-harvesting was exposed, also in March, the resulting stink led to Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s boss, being summoned before America’s Congress.* Cambridge Analytica shut down in May. (Its staff have since set up a new firm, called Auspex International.)
1. illicit:not allowed by laws or rules, or strongly disapproved of by society
2. [2]当数据收集被曝光时，也是在3月，随之而来的麻烦事导致Mark Zuckerberg被美国国会传唤。

*[3]Internal documents show that Google’s lawyers were well aware of the risks of admitting to their own bug in the midst of the Cambridge Analytica furore.* Disclosing it, they wrote, could invite “immediate regulatory interest”, and lead to Google “coming into the spotlight alongside or even instead of Facebook”. Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, might even have been dragged before legislators along with Facebook’s Mr Zuckerberg.
1. [3]内部文件显示，谷歌的律师们非常清楚在引起公愤的剑桥分析事件档口承认软件漏洞的风险。

There are differences between Google’s case and Facebook’s. Only a hundredth as many people were affected. In a blog post Google said that, as far as it could tell, nobody else had spotted the bug and no data had actually leaked (although, less reassuringly, the firm keeps only two weeks of log data at any one time).*[4]That meant that, according to both the law and Google’s internal guidelines, there was no need to do anything other than fix the problem and stay mum.*
1. [4]这意味着根据法律和谷歌的内部治理方针，除了解决问题和保持沉默之外，没有必要做任何事情。

*[5]That has not silenced claims of a cover-up: at least one lawsuit has already been filed. Perhaps to soften such accusations, the rest of the blog post talked at length about better privacy protections for users of Google’s other products.* The firm plans to stop many third-party developers from reading text messages and call logs on smartphones running its Android operating system, for instance, and to reduce the number of developers allowed to develop add-ons to Gmail, a free email service that shows advertisements to users based on the content of their messages.
1. [5]这并没有平息关于掩盖真相的说法：至少已经提起一个诉讼。或许是为了缓和这种指责，博客文章的其余部分详细地讨论了使用谷歌其他产品的用户的更好的隐私保护。
2. 此次事件的影响：谷歌计划阻止许多第三方开发者阅读文本信息和在运行Android操作系统的智能手机上调取日志，例如减少可以为Gmail开发插件的开发者数量。

*[6]Tightening access to personal data should help make accidental exposures less likely in future.* At the same time, regulators are picking up their cudgels. The EU’s General Data Protection Regulation came into force in May, two months after Google found its bug; it requires firms to disclose data breaches within 72 hours or face steep fines. *[7]California has passed a data-privacy law of its own, helped along by the Cambridge Analytica affair.*
1. [6]收紧对个人数据的访问应该有助于避免以后的意外数据泄露。
2. [7]在剑桥分析事件的促进下加州已经通过了自己的数据隐私法。

*[8]The internet giants seem to have accepted tighter regulations as inevitable.*Their objective now is to try to shape them as best they can. Several big computing firms, including Google and Facebook, are lobbying America’s federal government over national privacy rules, to avoid having to comply with a patchwork of local state codes. *[9]The foxes have decided their best bet is to try to help build the henhouse.*
1. [8]互联网巨头似乎已经接受了更严格的监管是不可避免的事实。
2. [9]狐狸们(指代互联网巨头)认为他们最好的办法就是试着帮助修建鸡舍(完善隐私保护相关法律)。
