Stockmarkets ended October on a positive note. But that was not enough to stop the month from being one of the worst for equities since the financial crisis. Markets were weighed down by investors’ jitters over rising interest rates, the slowing Chinese economy and uncertainty about global trade tensions. Some $5trn was wiped off the value of shares globally. The sell-off in tech shares was particularly brutal. The tech-heavy NASDAQ index fell by 9% during October.

10月末股市回暖一点，但10月份仍然是自经济危机以来股市表现最差的月份之一。投资者对利率上升、中国经济放缓以及全球贸易紧张局势的不确定性感到不安，令市场承压。全球股市市值蒸发了约5万亿美元。科技股的抛售尤其惨烈。以科技股为主的纳斯达克指数10月份下跌9%。

America’s economy grew at an annualised rate of 3.5% in the third quarter, driven by a surge in consumer spending that compensated for weaker business investment. The second quarter chalked up growth of 4.2%, which makes this the economy’s best six-month performance since mid-2014.

美国经济第三季度的年化增长率为3.5%，这是由于消费支出的激增弥补了商业投资的疲软。第二季度的经济增长率为4.2%，这是自2014年年中以来经济表现最好的6个月。

Economic growth in the euro zone slowed sharply in the third quarter, to 1.7%, year on year, compared with 2.2% in the previous three months. Inflation rose to 2.2%, the highest since December 2012.

欧元区经济增长在第三季度大幅放缓，同比增长1.7%，而前三个月为2.2%。通胀率升至2.2%，为2012年12月以来的最高水平。

Tensions surfaced between the government of India and the country’s central bank. The finance ministry has been putting pressure on the Reserve Bank of India to ease monetary policy and lending restrictions. The bank’s deputy governor warned of “catastrophic” consequences if the government tried to interfere with its independence. 

印度政府和央行之间的紧张关系浮出水面。印度财政部一直在向印度央行(Reserve Bank of India)施压，要求其放松货币政策和放贷限制。印度央行副行长警告说，如果政府试图干预其独立性，将会带来灾难性的后果。

The yuan hit its weakest point since the financial crisis, coming close to breaking the symbolic mark of seven yuan to the dollar. China’s central bank sets a daily peg around which the currency can trade. A weaker Chinese currency makes Chinese exports cheaper, a boon to Beijing in its battle to offset the Trump administration’s punitive tariffs.

人民币汇率跌至金融危机以来的最低点，接近打破7元兑1美元的象征性关口。中国央行设定了人民币汇率每日浮动区间。人民币贬值使中国出口的产品更便宜，这对中国政府抵消特朗普政府惩罚性关税的努力来说是一个福音。

The main grievance behind those tariffs is America’s accusation that China is stealing technology secrets. This week the Commerce Department slapped a ban on American companies from supplying components to Fujian Jinhua, a Chinese chipmaker that is accused by Micron, an American rival, of intellectual-property theft. Similar American restrictions on ZTE brought that Chinese company to its knees earlier this year.

美国对中国惩罚性关税主要是因为对中国窃取技术机密的不满。本周，美国商务部下令禁止美国公司向中国芯片制造商福建金华供应零部件。美国竞争对手美光科技指控福建金华窃取知识产权。今年早些时候，美国对中兴通讯的类似限制令这家中国公司屈服。

Investors breathed a sigh of relief after Facebook reported a solid quarter. Markets were keenly awaiting the social network’s earnings after a downbeat assessment it issued in July about its business wiped billions from its stockmarket value. Facebook made a net profit of $5.1bn in the third quarter on revenues of $13.7bn. Both figures were up from the comparable period last year, though the pace of growth was the slowest for some years.

Facebook公布了稳健的季度业绩后，投资者松了一口气。在7月份发布了一份悲观的评估报告后，市场热切等待着这家社交网络公司的盈利业绩。这份评估报告显示，该公司的业务价值被抹去了数十亿美元。Facebook第三季度实现净利润51亿美元，营收137亿美元。这两个数字都高于去年同期，不过增速是几年来最慢的。

In the biggest deal to date in the software industry, ibm said it was buying Red Hat, the world’s largest seller of open-source products, for $34bn. The takeover catapults ibm into the big league of cloud-computing services, a business in which it has struggled to make a mark.

IBM表示将以340亿美元收购全球最大的开源软件Red Hat，这是软件行业迄今最大的一笔交易。这次收购使ibm进入了云计算服务的大联盟，而在这一领域，ibm一直在努力取得成功。

Workers at Google staged walkouts at several offices around the world to protest against what they say is the company’s lax handling of sexual-harassment claims. It is the latest activist-led incident at Google, which, if conducted by unions, would be described as industrial action.

谷歌员工在世界各地的几个办公室上演了罢工，抗议他们所说的公司对性骚扰指控处理不力。这是谷歌最新的由活动人士领导的事件，如果由工会领导，将被描述为劳工行动。

General Electric’s troubles deepened, as it revealed that the Justice Department had opened a criminal investigation into its accounting practices and the Securities and Exchange Commission had expanded the remit of its inquiries. Both probes focus on a write-down related to GE’s power business, which caused it to report a quarterly loss of $22.8bn, one of the biggest ever. GE slashed its dividend to just one cent a share.

通用电气的麻烦加剧了，该公司透露，美国司法部(Justice Department)已对其会计操作展开刑事调查，美国证券交易委员会(sec)已扩大了调查的范围。两项调查都聚焦于与通用电气电力业务相关的资产减记。该业务导致通用电气季度亏损228亿美元，是有史以来最大的亏损之一。通用电气将股息削减至每股1美分。

General Motors steered its business to a 25% jump in operating profit for the latest quarter. It offset falling car sales in America and China by shifting pricier models. Volkswagen also had a good quarter, despite tougher car-emissions standards in Europe, with net profit rising to €2.7bn ($3.1bn).

通用汽车(General Motors)3季度的营业利润提高了25%。通过销售价格更高的车型，通用汽车抵消了美国和中国汽车销量的下降。尽管在欧洲有更严格的汽车排放标准，大众3季度表现也不错，其净利润上升到€27亿欧元(31亿美元)。

A slump in demand for its vehicles, particularly in China, drove Jaguar Land Rover to its second quarterly loss of the year. The carmaker announced a cost-cutting plan that could lead to more job losses.

捷豹路虎(Jaguar Land Rover)今年第二次出现季度亏损，尤其是在中国市场。这家汽车制造商宣布了一项削减成本的计划，这可能导致更多的失业。

Way to go
Waymo, an autonomous-car project backed by Google’s parent company, Alphabet, was awarded the first permit in California to test fully driverless vehicles, without a standby driver sitting inside, on the state’s public roads. Waymo will conduct its trials on the streets and highways around Silicon Valley, assuring residents that its cars can “safely handle fog”. Meanwhile, Alphabet said that passengers were now paying for rides in Waymo’s experimental minivans in Phoenix, which means that Waymo’s autonomous cars are the first to introduce commercial charges.

由谷歌母公司Alphabet支持的无人驾驶汽车项目Waymo在加州获得了第一个许可，可以在加州的公共道路上测试完全无人驾驶汽车，而不需要坐在里面的值守司机。Waymo将在硅谷周围的街道和高速公路上进行测试，向居民保证其汽车能够安全应对雾霾。与此同时，Alphabet还表示，乘客们正在为Waymo在凤凰城的实验性微型面包车付费，这意味着Waymo的自动驾驶汽车是首个引入商业收费的汽车。
