The gap between rich and poor Chinese regions is widening again

The underlying picture is even more worrying. Fiscal deficits (the gap between government revenues and expenditures) have remained low on the south coast, rising from 2% in 2000 to 3.9% today. In western and central China, deficits have expanded rapidly, from an average of 5.5% to 15.5% (see chart). Land sales and transfers from the central government have kept local governments afloat, but will diminish as growth slows. 

The change in regional fortunes is partly the result of investment flows. In 2000 the construction of things such as roads, railways and factories accounted for roughly a third of gdp in all regions. By 2015, as a result of the government’s drive to boost the interior, the ratio had risen to 43% in the south coast, but to 68% in the west and to 60% in the centre (see chart). With investment now tailing off inland, their growth is also beginning to falter. 

The slowdown in investment will be easier to stomach for places that have spent money well. The central city of Wuhan should benefit. It has been a focal point of China’s efforts to cultivate its semiconductor industry. But cities that have got it wrong will suffer. Chongqing, in the west, worked to attract car and computer manufacturers. As sales of both have weakened, so has Chongqing’s economy. It went from being one of China’s zippiest cities, growing by 17% in 2010, to one of its slowest, growing by 6% last year. “Everyone says we got hit by a financial crisis,” says Liao Li, a saleswoman in a small home-decoration shop there. It is not that bad, but Chongqing’s decline has been sudden. 

Plenty of industries on the south coast have also run into trouble, from shipbuilding in Jiangsu to garment-making in Guangdong. But the region’s economy is more diversified, and so more resilient. It is strong in modern services, from software design to wealth management. And it is still an industrial powerhouse. Many of its manufacturers have spent heavily on automation. Its smaller firms have also adapted. Scholars estimate that 77% of China’s “Taobao villages”—ones deriving much of their sales from e-commerce platforms such as the eponymous one—are based on the south coast. 

As China’s economy matures, the south coast’s advantages are likely to grow. The region is well-suited to knowledge-based industries. It generates half of all patent applications nationwide. Since 2015 worker productivity has increased by 7.4% annually on the south coast, more than any other part of China, according to Moody’s Analytics, a consultancy. It is also a magnet for foreign firms: 87.5% of foreign direct investment flowed to coastal China in 2017, official figures show. Many foreign managers say the business climate in the south is better. “Guangdong is like a spa,” says a European executive who recently launched a big project there, having previously endured frustrations in the interior.

One incentive that is often touted for producing goods in China’s interior is lower wages. But the region’s workers usually earn more than those in South-East Asian countries: twice as much as in poorer ones such as Vietnam and a tenth more than in wealthier ones such as Thailand. The trade war with America strengthens the headwinds. Firms that might have moved inland from the coast are instead looking abroad. Industrial activity has been declining more rapidly as a share of the interior’s economy than of the south coast’s. In western China, for example, it has fallen from 51% of gdp in 2011 to 41% last year.

China’s leaders will not give up. In recent speeches President Xi Jinping has declared that reducing the economic gap between regions remains a crucial goal. Local officials are still trying to pursue it. Nearly an hour’s drive from Baiguan’s would-be textile centre, the city of Zhuzhou has created “Power Valley”, which local officials hope will become a manufacturing base for the railway, car and plane industries. It is a well-manicured zone with crisp factory buildings, a slogan (“beautiful intelligence town”) and a big government office dedicated to making it work.

But nearly four years on from its opening, Power Valley is clearly low on fuel. A clerk at the reception says it has 80% occupancy. Yet just outside her door, there is half a block of abandoned offices. Down the road, one of the bigger occupied buildings belongs to a car-design company. Its manager sheepishly admits that he obtained a five-year lease rent-free. Ten employees are spread across four floors. “We are racing to catch up with the coast,” he says. The race already seems lost.
