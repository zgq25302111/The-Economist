1.And unfortunately, the more ambitious you are, the more the world will try to tear you down.
不幸的是，你越有野心，这个世界就越想把你打倒。

2.The best way to be good at sales is to genuinely believe in what you’re selling. 
做好销售的最好方法是真正相信你所销售的东西。

3.Most people overestimate risk and underestimate reward. Taking risks is important because it’s impossible to be right all the time—you have to try many things and adapt quickly as you learn more.
大多数人高估了风险而低估了回报。冒险是很重要的，因为不可能一直都是正确的——你必须尝试很多事情，并在学习的过程中迅速适应。

4.Once you have figured out what to do, be unstoppable about getting your small handful of priorities accomplished quickly. I have yet to meet a slow-moving person who is very successful.
一旦你明白了该做什么，就不可阻挡地迅速完成你的小任务。我还没有遇到过行动缓慢却非常成功的人。

5.One more thought about working hard: do it at the beginning of your career. Hard work compounds like interest, and the earlier you do it, the more time you have for the benefits to pay off. It’s also easier to work hard when you have fewer other responsibilities, which is frequently but not always the case when you’re young.
还有一个关于努力工作的思考:在你职业生涯的早期就努力工作。努力工作比如跟兴趣结合，越早开始，你获得回报的时间就越长。当你有更少的其他责任时，努力工作也更容易，这在你年轻的时候经常发生，但并不总是这样。

6.A big secret is that you can bend the world to your will a surprising percentage of the time.
一个很大的秘密是，你可以让世界在很大程度上听从你的意愿.

7.People have an enormous capacity to make things happen. A combination of self-doubt, giving up too early, and not pushing hard enough prevents most people from ever reaching anywhere near their potential.
人有巨大的能力让事情发生。自我怀疑、过早放弃、不够努力，这些因素综合在一起，阻碍了大多数人发挥自己的潜能。

8.An effective way to build a network is to help people as much as you can. Doing this, over a long period of time, is what lead to most of my best career opportunities and three of my four best investments.
建立人际关系网的一个有效方法就是尽可能地帮助别人。这样做，长期坚持，促成了我大部分最好的职业机会和四个最好的投资中的三个。

9.One of the best ways to build a network is to develop a reputation for really taking care of the people who work with you. Be overly generous with sharing the upside; it will come back to you 10x.You want to have a reputation for pushing people hard enough that they accomplish more than they thought they could, but not so hard they burn out.
建立人际关系网的最好方法之一就是树立一个真正关心同事的声誉。在分享优势时过分慷慨，它会返还给你10倍的回报。你想要有这样的名声，那就是给人们足够的压力，让他们完成比他们想象中更多的事情，但又不让他们精疲力尽。

10.Everyone is better at some things than others. The best way to make up for your weaknesses is to hire complementary team members instead of just hiring people who are good at the same things you are.
每个人在某些方面都比别人强。弥补你的弱点的最好方法是雇佣互补的团队成员，而不是只雇佣和你擅长同一件事的人。

11.The most successful people I know are primarily internally driven; they do what they do to impress themselves and because they feel compelled to make something happen in the world. After you’ve made enough money to buy whatever you want and gotten enough social status that it stops being fun to get more, this is the only force I know of that will continue to drive you to higher levels of performance.
我所认识的最成功的人主要是由内部驱动的;他们所做的一切都是为了给自己留下深刻的印象，因为他们强烈的感到要在这个世界上有所作为。当你赚了足够的钱能买任何你想要的东西，获得了足够的社会地位，以至于获得更多不再是一件有趣的事之后，这是我所知道的唯一的力量，将继续推动你获得更高水平的成就。
