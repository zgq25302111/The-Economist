Thousands Are Forced to Flee Dangerous Floods in Northern California

Catastrophic flooding in Northern California left thousands of people evacuated, hundreds of homes underwater and the town of Guerneville in Sonoma County, above, a veritable island.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Thursday declared states of emergency for five counties— Amador, Glenn, Lake, Mendocino and Sonoma. Road closures and evacuation orders remained in place in parts of Sonoma County, particularly for communities in the Russian River Valley, north of San Francisco. County officials said they were tracking floodwaters and assessing the conditions of roads and bridges after some towns recorded record rainfall.

Scott Rowe, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said Thursday that major flooding was continuing in communities near the Russian River. Guerneville and nearby areas received 20 inches of rain in about two days, he said. Flooding was expected to continue through Friday.
