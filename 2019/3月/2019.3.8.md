Declare Victory, Not Emergency
President Trump’s declaration of a national emergency is a perfect example of his tendency to pitch himself into unnecessary conflicts, drawing attention away from his successes.

His wins on border security have been considerable. In February Congress passed an appropriations bill that gave the administration $1.4 billion to fund the wall. The president tapped an additional $3.1 billion of nonemergency funds from the Treasury Department’s drug forfeiture account and the Pentagon’s drug-interdiction program, giving the administration an impressive $4.5 billion to build the wall. The new appropriation law also includes a substantial allocation of $22.5 billion for other border-security measures.

That should have been good enough for Mr. Trump. In a divided government, no president gets everything he wants from Congress, but he got a lot. Unfortunately, he decided to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory and invoke emergency powers in an attempt to get additional $3.5 billion for the wall from the Pentagon’s military-construction budget.

The problem with his emergency declaration, regardless of its legality, is that his pursuit of border security will now be plagued by press coverage of every setback he suffers in pursuit of the emergency wall funding.

It would have been so much better for Mr. Trump, and the country, if he had declared victory and celebrated the funding he secured instead of fighting over money he didn’t receive. He could have tweeted every time a new mile of wall was built. Mr. Trump could have filmed himself at the border, watching all the new drones, canine teams and high-tech antidrug surveillance in action. He could have publicly welcomed the 800 new Customs and Border Patrol officers Congress approved to their first day on the job.

But because he declared an emergency, his efforts to secure the border will be overshadowed by congressional votes to block the extra funding. Mr. Trump’s veto of that measure, and Congress’s attempt to override that veto, will distract from the money he did receive. When a federal judge inevitably enjoins his emergency action, it will be front-page news. So too with the appeals court, and so on until the Supreme Court finally weighs in.

The president never shies away from a fight, but not every brawl is worth it. If Congress had not acted and no compromise had been reached, then Mr. Trump would have a better reason to declare an emergency. But when Congress acts, and especially when the president signs the compromise, his case for declaring an emergency is weakened.

The battle over the border would have ended so much better had the president kept the nation’s attention on his substantive successes, instead of his process-oriented setbacks.
