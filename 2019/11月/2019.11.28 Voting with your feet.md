Voting with your feet

Moving lets people choose the kind of society they live in

When a voter casts a ballot, his choice is unlikely to affect his life. If he votes with his feet, there is a good chance he will change his life dramatically, observes Ilya Somin of George Mason University, author of a forthcoming book, “Free to Move”.Consider Edinson Infante, a Venezuelan who makes handbags out of banknotes, folded and glued together. A single lipstick placed in one of his bags is worth far more than the stack of Bolivars from which it was made. That is why Mr Infante emigrated.

He could not make a living in Venezuela, a socialist dictatorship. So he moved to Colombia, the reasonably well-run country next door, where he sells his art on the streets. He now earns enough to pay rent, eat properly and send groceries home to his mother. He says he feels free in Colombia. He can stroll without feeling scared, and afford occasional treats like caramel sweets.

Since 2014,4.6mVenezuelans have voted with their feet against the violent, corrupt regime of Nicolás Maduro— a seventh of the population. In a country where elections are rigged, the only way they can get a better government is to go and find one.

Foot-voting can take place over any distance and for many reasons. A person may move from Congo to Botswana to be better governed, or from New York to Florida for a lower tax bill and kinder weather. Foot-voters are typically better informed than ballot- casters. One vote is unlikely to affect an election result, so hours spent analysing each candidate’s policies are probably wasted. When migrating, by contrast, an informed choice pays huge dividends and an ignorant one can spell disaster.

If people were allowed to vote freely with their feet, they would have more choices about the kind of society in which they lived. A gay man might choose to leave Iran, where his love is punishable by death, and move to Uruguay, where he could get married. A traditional Saudi man might choose to remain in Saudi Arabia, where Islamic piety is enforced and women are kept in their place. His wives might prefer to move to Canada, where they would be free to divorce him. The biggest gains from foot-voting often accrue to illtreated groups such as ethnic and sexual minorities, and women.

The lengths to which people will go to vote with their feet give a hint of how large the benefits can be. Emmanuel, for example, left Gabon because it fails to protect young women like her from sexual violence. Her father used to abuse her. When her mother found out, she blamed Emmanuel, beat her, threw her clothes into the street and ordered her out of the house.

It is hard enough reporting a sex crime in a rich democracy, where the police are trained to treat allegations sensitively. In Gabon the cops are as scary as the criminals. Emmanuel saw no chance of justice, so when a friend offered her a plane ticket to Turkey, she went. From there, heavily pregnant, she boarded a flimsy boat bound for Greece. It leaked, and began to sink. She fell into the freezing water. Her friends called the coastguard, who found her after 45 minutes. Amazingly, both she and her baby survived. Now in Athens, she helps out at Melissa Network, a refugee charity, and hopes to train as a medical secretary. She says she feels much safer in Greece: “You have human rights here.”
