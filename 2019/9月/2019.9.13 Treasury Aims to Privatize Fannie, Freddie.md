Treasury Aims to Privatize Fannie, Freddie

WASHINGTON—The Trump administration said it would support returning mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to private hands, a development that could keep the companies at the center of the housing market for decades to come.

The principles announced Thursday represent a major reversal from what leaders of both parties over the past decade promised—to abolish the companies, which guarantee roughly half of the U.S. mortgage market. The administration’s approach, which doesn’t require approval by Congress, would mark a win for investors who have been betting politicians wouldn’t follow through on those promises.

Treasury officials said they would aim to privatize the government-controlled firms without making it tougher and more expensive for people to get mortgages. They generally avoided making specific policy recommendations on how to accomplish these goals in a report released Thursday.

They said they would work with federal regulators to flesh out the details on how to put Fannie and Freddie on a sounder financial footing as well as to curtail the firms’ roles in housing finance. The process could take years to implement and won’t affect existing mortgages.

“Our view is that the government footprint has become too big,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in an interview ahead of Thursday’s report. “There are people in Washington who are happy to leave this the way it is for another 10 or 20 years, and that’s not us. We feel an obligation to try to fix this.”

Fannie and Freddie don’t make loans but instead buy them from lenders and package them into securities that are sold to other investors. Figuring out how to refashion the companies remains the largest single piece of unfinished business from the financial crisis. The government assumed control of the firms in 2008 during the height of the crisis to prevent their failure, which officials’ feared would trigger a broader collapse in the housing market.

The report says the government would continue to backstop the companies after they are privatized, providing a line of credit in times of emergency, in return for a periodic fee.

If the administration follows through on privatizing the firms, they would essentially return to a status similar to before the financial crisis, with their effective duopolies intact, for lack of a better alternative.

Treasury officials minimized the risks, saying privatization will be slow and incremental and that they won’t upend the availability of the 30-year fixed rate mortgage, a product ensured by Fannie and Freddie’s business.

It also could be hard to meaningfully shrink the firms’ housing footprint without affecting borrowing costs. If some mortgages are no longer bought by Fannie and Freddie, they would be bought by private investors who would demand higher interest rates because the loans wouldn’t have government backing.

Left unresolved were several key questions, such as what to do with the government’s large stakes in the firms and how, exactly, to build up their capital so they can operate as private companies again.
