Trump Eyes California on Emissions

The Trump administration is pressing regulators to accelerate the rollout of new tailpipe- emission rules, an attempt to strike back at California for cutting a side deal with several auto makers to set standards that are tougher than those proposed by the administration, according to people familiar with the White House’s plans.

As part of that effort, officials could move within the next few days to curb California’s influence on the car industry, say these people and others familiar with the administration’s thinking. That could be a more aggressive attempt to end its longstanding authority to set its own emissions rules or threats to dissuade auto makers from collaborating further with the state, these people say.

The White House has been proposing to ease requirements originally set under the Obama administration.

Auto makers are worried the administration’s efforts are too confrontational with California and will result in a protracted legal battle between the federal government and the nation’s most populous state. That could force manufacturers to meet two sets of tailpipe-emissions standards.

To ensure some certainty in future years, Ford Motor Co., Honda Motor Co., BMW AG and Volkswagen AG struck an agreement this summer with California to voluntarily meet a new set of standards that are tougher than the White House’s proposal—but tamer than the Obama era ones.

The companies have said the pact was intended to show support for a single, nationwide vehicle-emissions standard, rather than a patchwork of state-by-state rules. But the move by California frustrated some administration officials who viewed it as a disruptive power play, said one senior official and others briefed on the White House’s reaction.

“Quite frankly our rule is realistic, it’s a realistic and transparent fuel-economy standard that will reduce auto pollution—unlike what California is doing,” White House spokesman Judd Deere said. “Our focus is finalizing the rule.”

Spokespeople for the California governors’ office and the California Air Resources Board didn’t return a request to comment.

California has a federal waiver to set its own emissions rules, which the Trump administration wants to revoke to limit the state’s influence over the auto industry.

Within days of his taking office, car companies began lobbying Mr. Trump for relief on the Obama era standards, arguing they were too strict and didn’t take into account the shift in consumer preference for trucks and SUVs that burn more fuel.

Executives, however, didn’t expect such a drastic rollback by the administration, which wants to freeze the Obama era fuel economy standards at 2020 levels, or roughly 37 miles a gallon.

这些知情人士说，这可能是一种更激进的尝试，目的是结束加州长期以来制定自己的排放规则的权力，或者威胁要阻止汽车制造商与加州进一步合作。

Auto makers are worried the administration’s efforts are too confrontational with California and will result in a protracted legal battle between the federal government and the nation’s most populous state.
汽车制造商担心，特朗普政府的举措与加州的对抗过于激烈，将导致联邦政府与加州之间旷日持久的法律战。加州是美国人口最多的州。

这可能迫使制造商满足两套尾气排放标准。

这些公司曾表示，该协议旨在支持统一的全国汽车尾气排放标准，而不是各州规定的大杂烩。

但一位高级官员和其他了解白宫反应的人士说，加州的举动令一些政府官员感到失望，他们认为这是一场颠覆性的权力游戏。

加州有一项联邦豁免，可以制定自己的排放规则，特朗普政府希望撤销这项豁免，以限制加州对汽车行业的影响力。

特朗普上任几天后，汽车公司就开始游说特朗普放宽奥巴马时代的标准，称这些标准过于严格，没有考虑到消费者对耗油量更高的卡车和suv的偏好转变。

然而，高管们并没有预料到特朗普政府会做出如此大的让步。特朗普政府希望将奥巴马时代的燃油经济性标准冻结在2020年的水平，即每加仑大约37英里。
