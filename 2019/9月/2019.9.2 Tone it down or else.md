Tone it down, or else
Google laid out new staff guidelines in an effort to curb the disruptive internal political debates that have come to characterise its workforce. Its employees often take strident positions on social issues and have pressed management to cancel contracts, most notably with the Pentagon for an image- recognition system. This has left Google open to the charge that it has a leftish bias and stifles conservative views. Its latest rules ask staff “to do the work we’ve each been hired to do, not to spend working time on debates about non-work topics”.

A judge in Oklahoma ruled that Johnson&Johnson had broken the state’s “public nuisance” law with its aggressive marketing of opioids and ordered it to pay $572m. It was the first time a drugmaker had stood trial for its part in creating America’s opioid-addiction crisis; others have so far elected to settle rather than face a courtroom. Oklahoma had sought $17bn in damages. J&J said it would nevertheless appeal against the judgment, arguing it followed the rules.

Following the judge’s ruling it was reported that Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin , was in talks to settle its exposure to 2,500 outstanding opioid lawsuits. The negotiations involve the Sackler family, which owns Purdue and has seen some of its donations to museums returned over the opioid issue.

The latest escalation of the trade war saw China announcing new tariffs on $75bn-worth of American goods from September 1st. Donald Trump responded by announcing a five-percentage-point increase on existing and planned tariffs on Chinese exports.

In a Twitter outburst, Mr Trump described Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, as an “enemy”, after he dodged mentioning any further cuts to interest rates in his speech to central bankers at Jackson Hole.

More concerns were raised about the independence of India’s central bank, after it transferred its entire annual net income and excess reserves to the government. The $25bn windfall, along with a set of stimulus measures, will help kick-start a slowing economy. The Reserve Bank of India has come under political pressure to do more for the economy; its previous governor, Urjit Patel, resigned amid a row with the government last year.
