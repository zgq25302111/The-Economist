In Mesopotamia’s halls
Lamia al-Gailani-Werr, guardian of the smallest antiquities of Iraq, died on January 18th, aged 80

On that dreadful day in April 2003, some of the staff of the National Museum of Iraq met Lamia al-Gailani in the lobby. They were in such shock that they could not finish a sentence. Days after the American invasion, looters had got in and raided the place. They had rampaged unhindered for two days. Objects too heavy to carry had been smashed; about 15,000 pieces had been stolen. Even the ledgers and index cards on which the collection was catalogued— the record of the civilisations of Babylon, Assyria, Ur, Nineveh and Sumer, of mankind’s first cities, empires and writings— lay torn and scattered everywhere. Among them the deputy director sat crying, his face buried in his hands.

She did not have time for that. Instead she rushed to check her special treasures, 7,000 cylinder seals from ancient Mesopotamia, stored in a corner of the basement. They were so small: just tiny plugs or cylinders of limestone, marble or hematite, used to seal loans and contracts. It was only when they were rolled across wet clay—as in Babylon or Nineveh, and when she impressed them for displays—that the carvings and inscriptions in intaglio revealed, sharp as the original cutting, the world from 3,000 years before. King-gods sat on panelled thrones covered with fleeces, flanked by nude attendants with three sidelocks. Men rowed boats on a river, while women processed with baskets on their heads. Shamash, god of the sun, stood with one foot on a mountain and a saw in his hand. Goddesses swayed in beads and flouncy dresses. A man and a woman drank beer through straws, with filters at the ends to strain out worms. Gazelles lifted their long horns, date palms held out their branches, and crescent moons rose in the sky.

From looking so long at these seals, the subject of her thesis at University College London and her love ever since, she could tell the styles not only of different cities but of different workshops, from the carving of pleats or hair. From their impression, firm or vague, on ancient tablets, she knew how they had been handled. In contrast with her favourite large piece in the museum, the wonderful copper Bassetki statue of a seated human figure, these little seals had no obvious cachet. But almost every one had gone.

Despair came first; then fury. Iraqi archaeologists had warned the Americans beforehand, even going to Washington to beg them to protect the building. She lent weight to the delegation as someone who moved easily between Iraq and the West, living in London and returning to the museum, for months each year, to work on the seals. The Bush administration did nothing. A tank at last appeared at the museum entrance two months later, almost useless. “Stuff happens,” said America’s secretary of defence.

Yes, so it did, no thanks to him, and had been happening in her country for centuries before. In Baghdad her family, which was distinguished, had charge of the shrine of Abdul Qadir al-Gilani, a Sufi mystic of the 12th century; in the library was a battered small Koran, the sole survivor of the sack of the ruling Abbasids’ libraries by Mongol troops in 1258. In this “grandmother of all nations”, as she thought of Mesopotamia, every mound covered a lost city; if you only dug a hole, as any robber could, you found something. In the early 20th century, just before the borders of modern Iraq were drawn, Western archaeologists more or less took what they wanted. That plunder had been stopped by one intrepid Englishwoman, Gertrude Bell, who was her heroine for all kinds of reasons. Of course, she was a colonialist; but she was still devoted to the country, founded the National Museum and set rules for the export of antiquities, a fearless woman in a man’s world.

All that was worth imitating, especially the last part. Her family, despite its ancestry, did not care much for history or for girls knowing it. They had merely wanted her to be nice, speak English and get married, but she defied them to study first law, then archaeology (and then get married). From her first days at the museum in 1961, when it was still in central Baghdad, she strove to involve women more, watching as housewives on their way to the main bazaar stopped to examine the Babylonian lions and Assyrian winged bulls at the entrance gate. She lobbied tirelessly to go on digs, which well-behaved young women did not do, and was at last allowed to work on a small site, Tell al-Dhibai, just outside Baghdad. Small but very important, she always insisted, since in the 1930s it had produced a cuneiform tablet that proved Pythagoras’s theorem, 2,000 years before he had thought of it. Iraqi genius!

Yet there was no getting away from violence in her part of the world. She had only to look at the seals. Men fought with each other, and with lions which they threw in triumph over their heads. Bull-men struggled with human-headed bulls. The goddess Ishtar carried a bristling quiver of arrows, a club and a scimitar. In modern wars, the very smallness of the seals made them ideal booty. They could be fenced with almost no one noticing—unlike the lifesize terracotta lions of Tell Harmal or the Greek-Roman-Persian statues of Harat, world-famous treasures of the museum, which had their heads destroyed with sledgehammers.

She especially mourned the Harat figures. Their oddness was not only fun—togas worn with curled Eastern beards, Greek ringlets with Persian trousers—but also a sign that different cultures could blend, not fight. Yet even as the National Museum painfully got itself back together, eventually re-opening in 2015 with Americans now helping to recover objects and train new curators, alongside her, the bigots of Islamic State were destroying “unIslamic” sites all over Iraq, erasing the history she was trying to preserve.

Joy came when two American military police turned up to hand her the Bassetki statue, crusted with smelly gunk from the cesspit in which it had been hidden. Satisfaction came from choosing cylinder seals for a new museum, built with British help, in Basra. But she often spared a wistful thought for the rest of the collection. Only 600 seals had found their way back to the museum. The others had not shown up on the market. They must be sitting somewhere, probably out of the way of anyone who knew much about them. And each little cylinder encompassed a world.

Sentence:
Iraqi archaeologists had warned the Americans beforehand, even going to Washington to beg them to protect the building.
伊拉克考古学家事先警告过美国人，甚至去华盛顿恳求他们保护这座建筑。

她给代表团增加了分量，因为她很容易在伊拉克和西方之间穿梭，住在伦敦，每年都要花几个月的时间回到博物馆研究印章。

图书馆里有一本破旧的小古兰经，是1258年蒙古军队洗劫阿巴斯王朝统治时期的图书馆时唯一的幸存物。

从1961年她在博物馆的第一天开始，那时博物馆还在巴格达市中心，她努力让更多的女性参与进来，在去主要集市的路上，她看到家庭主妇们在入口处驻足观看巴比伦狮子和亚述带翅膀的公牛。

She especially mourned the Harat figures.
她尤其为哈拉特的人物感到悲哀。

Their oddness was not only fun—togas worn with curled Eastern beards, Greek ringlets with Persian trousers—but also a sign that different cultures could blend, not fight.
他们的古怪之处不仅在于他们的滑稽——托加斯蓄着东方卷曲的胡须，希腊人的卷发配着波斯的裤子——而且也表明不同的文化可以融合在一起，而不是相互争斗。

Yet even as the National Museum painfully got itself back together, eventually re-opening in 2015 with Americans now helping to recover objects and train new curators, alongside her, the bigots of Islamic State were destroying “unIslamic” sites all over Iraq, erasing the history she was trying to preserve.
然而，就在国家博物馆痛苦地重整旗鼓，最终于2015年重新开放时，美国人正在帮助找回文物，培训新的博物馆管理人。与此同时，伊斯兰国(Islamic State)的偏执分子正在摧毁伊拉克各地的“非伊斯兰”遗址，抹去她试图保存的历史。

Joy came when two American military police turned up to hand her the Bassetki statue.
当两名美国宪兵出现在她面前，把巴塞奇的雕像递给她时，她欣喜万分。

But she often spared a wistful thought for the rest of the collection.
但她在其他作品中却常常不去想那些伤感的事。

Only 600 seals had found their way back to the museum.

他们一定是坐在什么地方，也许是远离那些了解他们的人的地方。

And each little cylinder encompassed a world.
